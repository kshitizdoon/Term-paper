# This Repo contains my work on Research Paper under the guidance of Prof SK Mathur in a team of 11 members. The objective of the paper was to examine the impact of variables  
like wages, productivity, location, Agglomeration Index etc. on the exporting ability of a firm and differentiate between exporting firms and non-exporting firms in the   
Indian trade sector.
